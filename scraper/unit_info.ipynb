      "<p>This unit introduces key themes and theorists in contemporary social and political theory. In particular, it will explore competing diagnoses and responses to the winding back of the post-war compromises between democratic states and corporate capitalism. Rather than taking a serial approach to a study of social and political theories, the unit will focus on their, at times diametrically opposed, configurations of this broad problem complex. In an epoch in which neoliberal agendas have both provoked, and perhaps also been facilitated by, the surge of populist politics across the globe, we look to contemporary social and political theories to help us make sense of new developments, to diagnose their costs and unravel future potentials. Can social democratic reformism survive the era of Trump, Brexit and Hanson? Organised as a workshop series, the unit will draw from leading theorists such as: Agamben, Boltanski, Brown, Chakrabarty, Fraser, Foucault, Habermas, Harvey, Honneth, Peck. Examining a problematic that is of foundational importance in much current social and political research, this unit is relevant to students across the humanities and social sciences.</p>\n",

World-ready researchers must be able to navigate the digital sphere and recognise the dynamic and exciting potential offered by digital technology for their own research, while also critically assessing digital technologies. In this unit, which caters to dgital beginners and enthusiasts alike, students will learn how to think critically and creatively about potential new directions opened up for research by digital technologies, and how these might be applied to their own disciplines and research projects. Students will learn how to harness digital tools and technologies to enhance, optimise and automate their own research practices, focusing especially on how to use digital tools for research communication, engagement and impact. They will also learn how to think critically about the practical issues and ethics of the digital world.

      "<p>Molecular biology is a central science in twenty-first century biology and biotechnology. Understanding the fundamentals of molecular biology is essential for many other fields in the life sciences, including microbiology, cell biology, immunology, and development. Molecular biology makes a significant and increasing contribution to major sectors of our society including agriculture and medicine, and is also important in environmental science and forensics. In this unit we explore topics that allow students to obtain an advanced understanding of the mechanisms of molecular biology, including those of DNA replication and recombination, prokaryotic gene expression, eukaryotic gene expression, mobile elements, the functions of the nucleus, and epigenetics. We also address topics on the rapidly changing technologies in molecular biology, including those used in genome sequencing, metagenomics, systems and synthetic biology. Practical sessions complement the lectures and provide students with hands-on experience with a range of critical laboratory skills including those required for DNA and RNA isolation, PCR and RT-PCR, cloning, and bioinformatics. Students gain experience in working with both bacterial and eukaryotic systems in the laboratory classes so that their skills and experience are valuable for a variety of positions in both industry and research.</p>\n",

This unit requires you to piece together lines of evidence over the last 2.6 million years from cave and fluvial sediments, tree rings, pollen, ice cores, marine cores and landforms to establish a benchmark for environmental change and to define the normal range of variability. We can then use this benchmark as a context for present day changes to predict how the environment will change in the future and how landscapes, vegetation, fauna and humans will respond. The last 2.6 millions years saw dramatic changes as the environment swung in and out of huge glacials, where large sections of the planet were covered in ice, to interglacials, where the climate recovered and the environment flourished. We will use evidence of these changes from the local Australian landscape and investigate this evidence during field excursions, including a week-long field trip during the mid-semester break. Case studies include: reconstructing the last glacial maximum in NSW; how environmental change in Africa and Asia shaped human evolution; human-environmental interactions in Australia such as the mega fauna debate; and how forest fires and deforestation have affected our present-day climate. This unit contains compulsory fieldwork with an additional cost of approximately $250.</p>\n",

      "<p>The digital revolution has created an enormous volume of data about markets, customers and the business environment which marketers have sought to incorporate into their strategic decision-making. Yet, raw data on its own adds very little to the strategic decision process. Marketers need to understand how to organise and analyse available data to generate actionable insights. Such insights are useful in anticipating future consumer needs, identifying trends, forecasting market conditions, gauging competition and making informed predictions about an ever-changing environment. Marketers then utilise these insights to build compelling narratives and to provide actionable recommendations for important marketing decisions.</p>\n",
      "<p>In this unit students will investigate appropriate data, data sources and analytic techniques required to generate input for key marketing decisions regarding markets and customers. Students will assess suitable data analysis techniques and evaluate generated output to develop insights and determine potential marketing decision options. Additionally, students will appraise these key options by estimating likely impacts and integrating these impacts with practical organisational issues.</p>\n",

Students will comprehensively compare the remedies available in common law (contract and tort) and equity and the effects of statute on these remedial responses. Remedies is organised according to self-help remedies, such as rescission, and judicial remedies, with the latter categorised according to (i) clarification of rights and pre-trial orders; (ii) monetary orders underpinned by the goals of compensation or gains-based recovery; (iii) punishment and (iv) coercion. This unit &#39;closes the circle,&#39; bringing together the disparate elements of previous doctrinal units, refreshing, consolidating and extending prior study as a bridge into legal practice. Having a coherent understanding of the different remedial possibilities enables a practitioner to start with the client&#39;s desired outcome and work back to select the appropriate cause(s) of action. It also serves as a bridge between the identification of private law rights and liabilities and the practicalities of litigation to obtain the appropriate judicial order, a matter developed in subsequent units dealing with the rules of evidence and practice and procedure.\n",

The first weeks are devoted to the contemporary history of the region from the late nineteenth century to the rise of post-colonial states in the region. Broad-ranging theoretical concepts necessary for an understanding of Middle Eastern political processes, and different ways of looking at those processes, are considered in the first part. The unit then examines the structure of government and the politics of the region, drawing on some of the ideas from the earlier part of the unit. Particular attention is paid to the region’s ongoing relations with the West and the “war against terrorism”; the emergence and future prospects of religious fundamentalism; and the rise of Arab nationalism and Zionism. The Arab-Israeli conflict, the 2003 Iraq War and the impact of globalisation are also covered.</p>\n",

Furthermore, important concepts of pricing and reserving for future contingent liabilities are discussed. Equations of value are established to calculate net premiums. Prospective and retrospective net premium reserves required to meet future liabilities are determined and compared. Techniques of survival analysis are used to estimate survival distributions and evaluate risk factors in actuarial applications. Students performing satisfactorily well in ACST8042 and ACST8043 will meet the requirements to earn credit from Exam FAM of the Society of Actuaries.</p>\n",

      "<p>Theories and other frameworks in business, management and economics help organise knowledge objectivity by framing how and why individuals, organisations, and other entities behave the way they do. Understanding how and why behaviours occur is important for researchers because it provides them with explanations underpinning human behaviours. The focus of this unit is on developing your knowledge about seminal and contemporary research from a theoretical perspective. You will explore theory and research relevant to your discipline and their various interpretations to develop an appreciation of the scope of theory and research. In particular, you will develop knowledge, critical analysis, and creative thinking to examine and explain theory and research to solve research problems. You will also learn how to critically evaluate, synthesise, explain theory and concepts, and communicate your ideas to extend available theories in your discipline area.</p>\n",

Probability models and life tables are used to calculate the expected present values accurately based on ultimate or select mortality. Furthermore, important concepts of pricing and reserving for future contingent liabilities are discussed. Equations of value are established to calculate net premiums. Prospective and retrospective net premium reserves required to meet future liabilities are determined and compared.
