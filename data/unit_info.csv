To demonstrate these processes to students, we start by talking about the structure and function of DNA to show how it can act as a simple code for the construction of proteins. Students are then shown how proteins are constructed from the DNA code, and how those proteins can be used to build and maintain cells. Having established these basic principles, the unit then goes on to explain how cells construct multicellular organisms during development, and how the proper functioning of those organisms is maintained by regulating cellular activity.

The teams will be expected to organise, plan, and perform all other tasks associated with good engineering practice, including discussion and reflection around the engineering problem and the engineering process. Individual and collective technical and professional competencies will be demonstrated through the production of a substantial report and presentation for consideration. An appreciation of the various contexts and factors impacting upon engineering practice will be developed.</p>

The unit will therefore give priority to richly experiential accounts made available in ethnographies, as well as in other kinds of writing such as literature and introduce us to a perspective called phenomenology.

This unit will explore how cultural norms around gender and sexuality have defined, constructed, constrained, or expanded people&#39;s notions of self, their bodies, and their health in specific sociocultural contexts. The anthropological understanding of gender and sexuality, as well as health, provides a fresh lens on what appears, when viewed in terms of international politics, as &#39;global imperatives&#39; - the imperative to control female sexuality and population, for example, or to categorise male and femaleness, or to control disease epidemics such as AIDS. Every one of these imperatives in fact is mediated and refracted through understandings and meanings that cling to what is most immediate and local to each of us, namely, our bodies. Anthropology understands these meanings as simultaneously symbolic, biological and existential, but the meanings are also historically and culturally specific.

Environmental justice highlights how responsibility for, and the burdens of, environmental degradation are unevenly distributed across space and scale, and divided between and within social categories such as race, class, gender, ethnicity and species. Environmental justice and decision-making are analysed through a series of case studies that are presented by academic staff and environmental professionals.

These ideas &#39;frame&#39; the problems policies address and how those problems will be solved. Policy ideas vary between policy domains and between countries and they change over time. Policy ideas are mobilised and contested by policy actors seeking changes that align with their own interests or those of their constituencies. When new ideas enter the policy process, they may offer genuinely novel solutions to old problems or renew the attractiveness of discarded approaches. New ideas can also function as solutions in search of problems. In this unit, students study policy documents and research resources to gain a critical understanding of how ideas can frame the definition of policy problems and their solutions. Because policy ideas travel, the unit considers the mechanisms and actors involved in what researchers call policy transfer or policy mobilities. Following an introduction to the role of ideas in policy, the unit is taught in three modules, each exploring the history, contours and impacts of a &#39;big idea&#39; that has come into public and social policy in recent decades.

By introducing the gradient, divergence and curl operators, the main properties of vector fields can be analysed.

<p>This foundation unit deeply engages students with the broad topics, big questions, strategies, new directions of scientific thought and break-through methods currently emerging in the biological, chemical, earth and environmental sciences. Activities undertaken include tailored workshops and presentations by research groups and academics, seminar attendance, directed reading of research literature, as well as the discussion and critique of wide-ranging research topics. Students will demonstrate their understanding of current research and develop their science communication skills based on the research frontiers explored; they will become embedded in our active research community, and reflect on their future goals in their chosen discipline.</p>
